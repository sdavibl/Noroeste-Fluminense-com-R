# Noroeste-Fluminense-com-R
This project uses R to analyze and visualize economic and social indicators of the Noroeste Fluminense region. By leveraging spatial data, I created maps to display relevant information, providing insights into regional trends and disparities. The project demonstrates data manipulation, visualization, and geospatial analysis in R.
